		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>Pastel de queijo are savory Brazilian cheese pastries. This appetizer and street food is something all cheese lovers definitely need to try!</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<h4>For The Pastel Dough</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>3 ½ - 4 c all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
			<li>1 Tbsp salt</li>
			<li>1 c water</li>
			<li>2 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
			<li>1 tsp white wine vinegar</li>
			<li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
			<li>2 Tbsp Cachaça (or white rum or vodka)</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>For The Cheese Filling</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>8 oz soft and melt-able cheese (mozzarella, cheddar, provolone, etc), sliced or cubed</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<h4>For The Pastel Dough</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>In a large bowl, mix together 3 ½ c flour and salt. Add the water, egg, oil, vinegar, and alcohol to the flour mixture and mix well. <br>
				Once the dough starts to come together, transfer it to a floured surface and knead until the dough is very smooth and elastic (5-7 minutes), adding extra flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to your hands or the counter.</li>
			<li>Cover the dough with a tea towel and let rest for 30 minutes - 1 hour.</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>To Make The Pastéis</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Divide the dough in half. Roll out one half as thinly as you can (aim for 1-2 mm thick).</li>
			<li>Using a round cookie cutter (we used a 3 ½ inch cutter), cut circles in the dough.*</li>
			<li>Place a couple cubes of cheese in each round of dough.</li>
			<li>Fold the dough over the filling to create a half circle. Press the edges of the pastel tightly closed using a fork, to seal the filling in. (If you are having trouble getting the edges to seal, or if your dough has set out for a while and started to dry, simply dip your finger in some water and use it to moisten the edges of the dough.)</li>
			<li>Continue rolling out the dough and filling it, until all the dough has been used. Heat a deep skillet (or saucepan) with enough oil to cover the pastéis (roughly 1-2 inches). Heat the oil to around 350F, but not smoking.</li>
			<li>Fry the pastéis until golden and crispy, turning once, being careful not to over-crowd your cooking oil. Frying time will vary depending on how hot your oil is, but it should take from around 1 - 3 minutes a side.</li>
			<li>Transfer the pasteis to a paper towel-lined plate and serve as soon as possible!</li> <br>
			*You could also use a knife or pizza cutter to cut the dough into squares or rectangles. And, technically, pastéis can be any size you would like.
